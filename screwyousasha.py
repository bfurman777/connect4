    # TODO
    '''
    X interface to play in terminal
    X recursive solution
    X memoization
    X better algo (some score for connect 3 without extra for a dead end 3? how about split 3s?)
    - pygame click to play
    - watch the screen and read/play automatically 
        - click the top left and bottom right spots, it calculates positions to motitor itself
